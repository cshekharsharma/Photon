// RealIP is a middleware that sets a http.Request's RemoteAddr to the results
// of parsing either the True-Client-IP, X-Real-IP or the X-Forwarded-For headers
// (in that order).
//
// This middleware should be inserted fairly early in the middleware stack to
// ensure that subsequent layers (e.g., request loggers) which examine the
// RemoteAddr will see the intended value.
//
// You should only use this middleware if you can trust the headers passed to
// you (in particular, the two headers this middleware uses), for example
// because you have placed a reverse proxy like HAProxy or nginx in front of
// router. If your reverse proxies are configured to pass along arbitrary header
// values from the client, or if you use this middleware without a reverse
// proxy, malicious clients will be able to make you very sad (or, depending on
// how you're using RemoteAddr, vulnerable to an attack of some sort).

// realIP extracts the real IP address from an HTTP request. It checks multiple
// header fields that are commonly used to store the client's IP address. The function
// prioritizes the headers in a specific order and returns the first valid IP address found.
//
// The function checks the following headers, in order of priority:
// 1. 'True-Client-IP' (usually set by proxies or load balancers)
// 2. 'X-Real-IP' (another common header set by proxies or load balancers)
// 3. 'X-Forwarded-For' (a standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client)
//   - If 'X-Forwarded-For' contains multiple IP addresses, separated by commas, the function
//     extracts the first one, assuming it's the original client IP.
//
// If no valid IP address is found in these headers, or if the headers are not present,
// the function returns an empty string. Additionally, it validates the extracted IP
// to ensure it's a well-formed IP address.
//
// Parameters:
//   - r: *http.Request, the HTTP request from which to extract the client's IP address.
//
// Returns:
//   - string: The extracted IP address as a string. If no valid IP address is found,
//     or if the extracted IP is not well-formed, the function returns an empty string.
